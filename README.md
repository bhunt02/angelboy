A 2D low-resolution game based on the 80's game Kid Icarus by Nintendo. 
Not intended for commercial use, simply a project to help me learn a bit more about developing video games, particularly in Java.
This project is (unfortunately) riddled with incorrect uses of resources, Java syntax, and a whole lot of spaghetti code. But in lieu of that, I've learned a lot about how to work with Java Swing and AWT, as well as (non-console) input handling.

## Note!
This repository includes some images created by Nintendo, which I have not obtained permission to use from them myself. 
This project is simply a parody of the game originally created by Nintendo and was created purely for satirical and educational purposes.
The resources used within this project will never and have never been used in a manner so as to gain profit.
